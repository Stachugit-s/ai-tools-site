## What is CustomGPT.ai?

CustomGPT.ai is a **no-code AI platform** that lets you build private, business-focused chatbots trained exclusively on *your* company's knowledge—not public internet data.

Unlike ChatGPT (which draws from general training data), CustomGPT uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** technology. This means every answer is grounded in your documents, PDFs, websites, and knowledge bases, with clickable source citations attached.

### Why Businesses Choose CustomGPT Over Generic AI

**The problem with ChatGPT for business:**
- Hallucinates facts (makes up information when unsure)
- Trained on public data (security risk for sensitive company info)
- No citations or source verification
- Generic responses, not brand-aligned
- No compliance controls (GDPR, SOC-2)

**Why CustomGPT is built for enterprises:**
- ✅ Anti-hallucination technology (answers grounded in *your* data only)
- ✅ Zero public training on your uploads
- ✅ Real-time citations for every answer
- ✅ SOC-2 Type II + GDPR compliant
- ✅ Deploy internally or publicly in 20 minutes
- ✅ No coding required
