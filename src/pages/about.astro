		<h2>About AI Tools Hub</h2>
		
		<p>
			We're on a mission to cut through the noise and provide honest, practical reviews 
			of AI tools that actually matter to content creators, marketers, and business owners.
		</p>

		<h3>Why We Exist</h3>
		<p>
			The AI tools landscape is crowded and confusing. Every week brings a new "revolutionary" 
			tool, but which ones are actually worth your time and money? We test them so you don't have to.
		</p>

		<h3>Our Review Process</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Hands-on testing:</strong> We actually use every tool we review</li>
			<li><strong>Real scenarios:</strong> We test with actual work, not toy examples</li>
			<li><strong>Honest opinions:</strong> We highlight both strengths and weaknesses</li>
			<li><strong>Regular updates:</strong> Tools evolve, so do our reviews</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Transparency</h3>
		<p>
			We believe in full transparency. Some links on this site are affiliate links, meaning 
			we may earn a commission if you make a purchase. This comes at no extra cost to you 
			and helps us keep the lights on.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Our reviews remain honest and unbiased regardless of affiliate relationships. If a tool 
			isn't good, we'll tell you – even if there's money on the table.
		</p>
